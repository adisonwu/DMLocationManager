# DMLocationManager: iOS CLLocationManager made easy

DMLocationManager made iOS's Location Manager easy to use. It supports blocks, reverse geocoding (from coordinates to address) and viceversa (from address string to it's GPS coordinates).
It's all block based and uses NSOperationQueue to optimize multiple requests.

## How to use it

DMLocationManager is a singleton class, so just call one of the available methods from [DMLocationManager shared] instance.
